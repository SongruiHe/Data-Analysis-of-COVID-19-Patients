# Data Analysis of COVID-19 Patients in South Korea
To date, COVID-19 has become one of the most serious human pandemics and has spread for more than 6 months. Identifying the susceptible people and taking preventive measures accordingly is the key point to defeat the disease. Based on the reported materials of KCDC, this paper adapted and evaluated several machine learning algorithms to predict the growth trend of new confirmed cases and identify patients with high death risks. In addition, graph mining techniques are used to analyze group infection and super infector cases. These methods and analysis provided instructive information to help tackle the global problem of Coronavirus.
